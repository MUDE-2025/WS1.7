# Workshop 1.7: Is it Melting?


In this notebook you will fit a model to a time series of height observations of a point on a glacier, to assess whether it is melting. 

**Learning objectives:**
- apply least-squares (LS) and best linear unbiased (BLU) estimation
- evaluate the precision of the estimated parameters
- discuss the differences between least-squares and best linear unbiased estimation
